        Compass Medical selects doctors based on their scientific qualifications, skills, and extensive experience in their specialties.\n
        Our doctors will exert every effort to utilize their knowledge, expertise, and the latest advancements in medicine to achieve an accurate diagnosis of your medical problem, provide appropriate treatment, and necessary health guidance to enhance your health until recovery.\n
        To achieve this, you must adhere to the doctor's instructions, guidance, and advice, and comply with the prescribed medications and methods of taking them. It should be noted that medicine is still incapable of addressing many medical conditions.\n
        For your safety, you must inform us of any drug allergies or significant side effects caused by medications.\n
        Compass Medical acts as an intermediary and organizer between the patient and the doctor and does not interfere in the consultation or its results.\n
        Our website maintains the confidentiality of the data and information you have shared, and only the site administrator and the doctor will have access to this data.\n
        It is not our responsibility if the country in which you reside does not dispense external prescriptions. In this case, you must visit your own doctor in your place of residence to obtain them.\n
        You have the right to request an invoice for the consultation fee, but we are not responsible if you are not reimbursed by insurance companies or any other party, and we kindly ask you not to discuss compensation with us.\n
        After completing your medical file, you will be informed of the consultation appointment within a period ranging from several hours to several days, depending on the size of the file and the doctor's availability.\n
        The maximum duration for speaking with the doctor via voice or video is 15 minutes.\n
        Some doctors accept urgent consultation appointments (within a period not exceeding 5 hours) and emergency appointments (within less than two hours). Urgent and emergency cases refer to non-life-threatening health conditions that do not require emergency treatment or direct medical intervention.\n
        If you request an urgent appointment, the consultation fee will increase by 20-50%, and late-night appointments will increase by 100%.\n
        After scheduling the medical consultation appointment, you can request a change of appointment once.\n
        When canceling the reservation more than 5 hours before the consultation appointment, only the company's service fee will be deducted from the amount, and if the reservation is canceled less than 5 hours before the consultation appointment, 50% of the amount will be deducted.\n
        (For example, if your appointment is at 18:00, if you cancel the appointment before 13:00, only the company's service fee will be deducted, and if you cancel the appointment after 13:00, 50% of the total amount will be deducted).\n
        If the doctor apologizes for the appointment due to an emergency reason, the full amount will be refunded, or you can request another appointment.\n
        If you miss the appointment due to an emergency reason, you can schedule another appointment for yourself.\n
